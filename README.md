# Welcome to my GitHub!

Hello, Iâ€™m Alex ðŸ‘‹

I started out in classical mechanical engineering and dove deeper during my PhD in fluid mechanicsâ€”picking up a love for mechatronics and software along the way. Today I focus on **automating engineering workflows**:

- **Design tools** for rapid aerofoil propeller geometry generation  
- **End-to-end CFD pipelines** that run with a single command  
- **Robotics software** for automated sensor positioning and real-time data evaluation in aerodynamic experiments  

Take a look around, and feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to collaborate or just talk shop!
