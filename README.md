# Welcome to my GitHub!

Hi, I'm Alexander!

I started my career as a mechanical engineer, but through my PhD in fluid mechanics I have transitioned to Python development. I have written programs to aid with computer aided engineering design and additive manufacturing (i.e. 3D-Printing). Furthermore I have written scripts to process and analyse complex data from pressure sensors used in wind tunnel testing.
