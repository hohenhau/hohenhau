# Welcome to my GitHub!

Hi, I'm Alexander!

I started my career as a mechanical engineering, but through my PhD in fluid mechanics I have transition to Python development. I have developed programs to aid with computer aided engineering design and addative manufacturing (i.e. 3D-Printing). Furthermore I have writted scripts to process and analyse large amounts of data from pressure sensors used in wind tunnel testing.
